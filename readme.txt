Always going back to the site map or dashboard, choosing the page you want to edit etc. 
With dmd Pages you can save those steps and can edit your pages easily. 
dmd Pages is a simple plugin which allows you to edit your pages very fast.

If you are on your website or on any other site of your wordpress area (design etc.),

It lists all the pages you have published on your website and directs you immediately to the edit page site.
